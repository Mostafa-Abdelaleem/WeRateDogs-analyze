    "* some columns have almost the same value for all records(source)\n",
    "* some of the values of extended URL are the same URL twice separated by a ','\n",
    "* extended URL have missing values\n",
    "* column timestamp is of type string\n",
    "* columns (doggo, floofer, pupper, puppo) are of type string\n",
